## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that would display the belly button bacteria information of the subject that is selected from the <code>Test Subject ID No.</code> drop-down, both textually and graphically. The text portion involved the creation of static <code>Demographic Info</code> table which contains summary statistics, like age, gender, and others. The graphical portion comprises three charts: a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a guage chart. 

## Operation

The dashboard operates as follows:

1. When the dashboard is first loaded, the display is created using the first item from <code>Test Subject ID No.</code> drop-down. The <code>Demographic Info</code> table and the three charts are created using the data pertaining to this subject.

2. When the user selects a different user from the <code>Test Subject ID No.</code> drop-down, the <code>Demographic Info</code> table and the charts are updated to display the data for the newly selected subject.

## Dashboard 

1. The first element of the dashboard is the <code>Test Subject ID No.</code> drop-down which allows the user to view the information pertaining to that particular subject.
